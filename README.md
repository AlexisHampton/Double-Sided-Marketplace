# Double-Sided-Marketplace

A project created by <a href="https://github.com/AlexisHampton">Alexis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyNDG">Anthony</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/iamX2001">Jevi</a>

Alexis: created functionality to read and write data from firestore
Anthony: set up Google authentication and bringing the front and back end together
Jevi: fine-tuned the user interface

Our Hardships:
Setting up firestore was a hassle for Alexis. She could not get it to work for a while, and when it did, debugging it was a nightmare
Bridging the gap between the front and back end was very difficult for Anthony. Try as he might, nothing would work
Unfortunately this meant, our project is unfinished in the one week we had to complete it. 

If we had more time, we would make it work. We might add features like messaging which allows students to question the companies they are coding for. 

Next steps:
In future projects, we will work on making sure our project fully works before working on cosmetics like CSS. Because having a project that works is better than not.
